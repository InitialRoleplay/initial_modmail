   * Fedora 38
   * Fedora 37

</Callout>

Fedora Linux 35 and above has all required packages available in official repositories. Install them with `dnf`.

```bash
sudo dnf -y install python310 git nano g++ gtk3
```

And then, make sure `pip` is installed for Python 3.10 with:

```bash
python3.10 -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

## Installing Bot

Clone and change directory into the Modmail folder with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/modmail-dev/modmail
cd modmail
```

And then, install `pipenv` and the bot dependencies with:

```bash
python3.10 -m pip install pipenv
python3.10 -m pipenv install --python 3.10
```

Create a file named `.env` with `nano` and paste all the environmental variables (secrets) needed to run the bot via right-clicking in the nano editor. Refer to the steps in the [parent Installation page](../#preparing-your-environmental-variables) to find where to obtain these.

```bash
nano .env
```

After that, press `Ctrl+O` and `Enter` to save your changes. Exit the `nano` editor with `Ctrl+X`.

<Callout emoji="ℹ️" type="info">
If using the `nano` editor is a bit of a learning curve, you can always FTP into your server using software like [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) to edit the `.env` file manually with your preferred GUI-based editor like Notepad.
</Callout>

After your `.env` file is ready, you can now go ahead and try running your bot with:

```bash
python3.10 -m pipenv run bot
```

If no error shows up, it means your bot is now running correctly. You can stop the bot from running with `Ctrl+C` to continue using your terminal.
